# About us

Welcome to Leberkasrechner! We're a community passionate about connecting people with local butchers and exploring a world full of gourmet food. While our platform is designed for finding butchers, we also cater to the needs of vegan, vegetarian, and other dietary groups.

Our mission is to enhance the quality and accessibility of OpenStreetMap data, particularly for local butchers. We believe in the power of Open Data and aim to make it easier for users to improve this data for everyone's benefit.

We're always looking for passionate individuals to join our community. If you believe in our mission, don't hesitate to get in touch. Whether you're a developer, a data enthusiast, or a gourmet food lover, there's a place for you at Leberkasrechner.
